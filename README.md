## This Project is a refinement of a former class group project for CSC405 at the University of North Carolina

This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project regarding the potential correlation between London weather conditions and the London Fire Brigade calls.

### Navigation

In this repository you will find this project is broken up into sections;

- EDA: Incorporates data cleaning, normalization, and visualization of clean vs 'dirty' data using Seaborn.
- Hypothesis Testing: Formulation of hypotheses that this data could address.
- Model Creation: Based on the hypotheses, machine learning models will be created to predict results of fire calls given weather data that day.
- Final Visualization: A final report of all work wrapped up into a PowerBI report.
